# ECE573_HW2
Homework 2 for ECE573: Data Structures and Algorithms at Rutgers University

By Brendan Bruce

Written and Tested on Python 3.5.6

**Q\* Folders** contain **Q\*.py** scripts and necessary data files to run scripts

**timing_experiments.py** runs scripts on varying data sizes and generates a figure to display the results

**HW1_Report.ipynb** is the notebook used to generate the report pdf

**HW1_Workbook.ipynb** is a notebook used when first working on the problems

**Problems.txt** contains the problem information

How to run scripts:
1. Change directory to Q* folder
2. Run script with args being the relative path to the data folder

Ex: 
1. cd Q1
2. Q1.py /data/data0.1024

Exception for Q3 (dataset is generated internally):
1. cd Q3
2. Q3.py
